efflux
======

What is it ?
------------

efflux is a JavaScript-based application that allows users to create music using user defined
WaveTable synthesis, all inside a browser.

Feature list
------------

- Create custom waveforms for multiple synth instruments
- Directly edit instrument output using the pattern editor
- Copy / clone patterns for nice and easy arranging
- Save songs locally to continue working on them later or export / import them between devices
- Input notes using a MIDI controller and/or record them live during playback

Sounds cool, but I don't want to build from source, I just want to tinker with this!!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Of course, it was made to allow for easy composition, so let's cut the chatter!
You can use the application right now from  your web browser by visiting [this link](http://www.igorski.nl/experiment/efflux).

Project outline
---------------

All source code can be found in the _./src_-folder and is written in ES6 (transpiled to ES5 for use in the browser)

 * _./src/assets_ contains all CSS style declarations in .less format as well fonts
 * _./src/js_ contains all JavaScript sourcecode with _main.js_ being the application entry point
 * _./src/js/workers_ contains all Workers (will be inlined using Blob URLs via Workerify for ease of deployment)
 * _./src/templates_ contains all HMTL snippets used by the application in Handlebars format
 * _./src/public_html_ contains the main HTML page that will link to the source output 

Additional folders:

 * _./design_ contains SVG icons that are combined into an icon font (by fontello)
 * _./fixtures_ can be filled with separate JSON files containing Song data, these will be concatenated into
   a single file that can be requested via Ajax on the first application start to provide demo content
   (see FixturesLoader.js)
 
The build scripts are defined in _./Gruntfile.js_ and includes snippets defined in the _./config_-folder.
 
Build instructions
------------------

You will need Node.js in order to run the build scripts and resolve the dependencies. The build script is
run using Grunt.

To build efflux first resolve all dependencies using Node:

    npm install
 
After which a development mode can be started (which conveniently opens your browser and points it to the correct
location at _http://localhost:3000_) using the following Grunt command:

    grunt dev
 
A production build (minimizes CSS and JS output size) can be created using the following Grunt command:

    grunt build
 
After which the build output is available in the _./dist/prod_-folder.
 
Unit testing
------------

Unit tests are run via Mocha, which is installed as a dependency. You can run the tests by using:

    npm test
 
Unit tests go in the _./test_-folder. The file name for a unit test must be equal to the file it is testing, but contain
the suffix "_.test_", e.g. _Functions.js_ will have a test file _Functions.test.js_.

NOTE : Node v 4.0 or higher must be installed for running the tests (these depend on jsdom)

KNOWN BUGS
----------

 * pitch down automation works in reverse...
 * altering delay time only works from module parameter automation, not when dragging its slider in the instrument editor...
 * delay module parameter mutations don't glide

ROADMAP
-------

 * When copy pasting a pattern in the same channels, don't adjust the note's channels indices
 * Minimize vendor libraries
 * Add pattern jump instructions
 * Add cut/paste icons for touch screen devices
 * Add EQ for each individual instrument for mix balancing
 * Improve arrow key navigation within patterns (there are odd jumps when switching direction)
 * Implement Instrument mute / solo
 * Add overdrive (npm: wa-overdrive)
